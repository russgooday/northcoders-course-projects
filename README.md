# Northcoders Course Projects
This repo contains a collection of tasks that were set for us during the Northcoders Data Engineering course. I have expanded on the briefs to include additional features and functionality in order to further explore more advanced concepts.

## Learning
Along with studying books and popular Python websites, I dedicated significant time to reviewing the source code of Python's standard libraries. This hands-on exploration of best practices and tools proved to be an invaluable learning experience.

## Projects
- [Project 1: Find most repeated](countem)

    Drawing inspiration from the collections module, I developed a class to count the frequency of items in a list and identify the most common ones.

    Key learning points include:

    - I gained an understanding of the pitfalls of subclassing built-in dict (written in C), such as shadowed methods being ignored, and why subclassing an ABC Mapping is a better approach.

    - I learned how to utilize `__dunder__` methods like `__add__`, `__sub__`, and `__ior__` for combining sets.

    - I enhanced my skills with Typing and Annotations, gaining insight into how to better structure my code.

- [Project 2: Supermarket Queue](heapify)

    To follow...
